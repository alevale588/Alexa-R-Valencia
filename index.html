        <p class="lead mb-4">My previous career experiences have been limited to fast food and retail as of the past few years. Due to the pandemic, I have not yet been able to fully immerse into opportunities such as internships and careers in my major. 
	  My first job was working at Subway. Although it was a fast food chain, I was provided opportunities to climb up the management ladder. Eventually, after about six months, I got the promotion to become a shift lead. Like previously mentioned, although lacking the professional atmosphere, having the opportunity to hold responsibility at a young age taught me various things about hard work and accountability. I applied these disciplines into my studies; this led me to begin my student career at The University of California, Riverside.

<br><br>

        Beginning my student career was far from easy, even the beginning stages proved themselves to be extremely difficult. Everything from the college application to the FAFSA form confused me as a first generation student. I was first accepted for a psychology major, but as time progressed I came to figure out that I truly wanted to pursue a degree in business. The major change was difficult, as I had to petition to take ARC35 and complete it. Now that I am pursuing the career that I flourish in, I have realized the attributes that I can bring to a professional setting.
	Due to all the circumstances I have experienced getting here, I have gained and refined professional characteristics I used to have. Working in customer service allowed me to gain the ability to properly communicate with a customer in order to sell the product in the most efficient way. The opportunity to interact with people everyday allowed me to meet people with different personalities; this taught me to hold my ground in a respectful and business like manner
<br><br>

        Similarly, being a first generation student taught me to be resourceful and persistent. There were many times in which I wanted to simply give up. However, instead I learned to be determined and searched for different ways to solve my problems. This was brought into my student career. By being determined I was able to change my major despite the issues that were presented. My career at The University of California, Riverside has been an enjoyable rollercoaster, and as a result I am very grateful for the fact that I refused to give up. 
	Outside of a professional and student setting, I have experience as a volunteer. I was a part of a program called C5, for 6 years. Being a part of this program was doing community service such as the beautification and clean up of nature. We also toured to multiple schools and presented information to other low-income students. C5 was an internship of shorts; I had the opportunity to meet with professionals of professions that range from multiple business careers, such as: corporate owners, non-profit organizations, and independent contractors. 
	All in all, my life, professional, and student experience has prepared me for a career in business.
